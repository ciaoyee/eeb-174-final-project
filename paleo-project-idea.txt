Conceptual Basis of Project
I thought it would be interesting to explore the effects of the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction on the diversity of squamata in modern times.

Discussion of data and computational challenges
I plan to use occurrence data from the PBDB to reconstruct and estimate fossil ranges so I can plot the diversity of my chosen species through time. I would also like to see if I can show in which locations the species were most dense (like which areas they populated most densely). I will have to extract fossil locality data and format it using various tools so I can make it easier to plot and visualize the data for my idea.
